# Multithreaded Job Market Scraper (C++)

This project is a high-performance, multithreaded web scraper built in C++ to analyze job market trends. It scrapes job postings from various online sources, extracts relevant skills and requirements, and aggregates data for insights.

## Features
- âœ… **Multithreading** â€“ Uses `std::thread` and `std::mutex` for concurrent scraping  
- âœ… **Networking** â€“ Fetches job listings using `libcurl` (or another HTTP library)  
- âœ… **HTML Parsing** â€“ Extracts relevant text using Gumbo, Lexbor, or another parsing library  
- âœ… **Data Processing** â€“ Aggregates scraped data to identify in-demand skills  
- âœ… **Performance-Oriented** â€“ Built in C++ for speed and efficiency  

## Goals
- ðŸ”¹ Analyze job postings to determine the most requested skills for different job titles  
- ðŸ”¹ Optimize concurrency for efficient scraping  
- ðŸ”¹ Handle rate limiting and avoid detection
